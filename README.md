# Task

I will be attempting to commit something to GitHub for this project every day. One of my problems is that I
think too long about how to do a project before just doing it. So, I'm going to try to do it.

I have no intentions with it other than displaying some valuable data that Norfolk provides.

# Resources I will be using for this project.

The Norfolk "Significant Trees Dataset". This can be found here: https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.norfolk.gov/jz6u-9g3c
