# norfolk-gui

Python GUI with Norfolk information for the public good.

# Task

I will be attempting to commit something to GitHub for this project every day. One of my problems is that I
think too long about how to do a project before just doing it. So, I'm going to try to do it.

I have no intentions with it other than displaying some valuable data that Norfolk provides.
